# EDF-MDB-Viewer
An OpenGL based Model Viewer for the 'mdb' file format found in Sandlot's "Earth Defense Force" video games.

# Requirements
OpenGL libraries (GLM, GL, ect), SFML libraries.

# Operation
As it stands now, it is cardcoded to load 'model2.mdb', and texture it with 'texture.dds', these files are extracted from "RAB" archives. Models with multiple objects and meshes will likley fail, due to an incomplete parsing method. This tool is incredibly bare-bones and serves only as an example at this current time.
